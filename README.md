Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning Classifiers
ABSTRACT
In this age of computer science each and every thing becomes intelligent and perform task as human. For that purpose there are various tools, techniques and methods are proposed. Support vector machine is a model for statistics and computer science, to perform supervised learning, methods that are used to make analysis of data and recognize patterns. SVM (Support Vector Machine) is mostly used for classification and regression analysis. And in the same way k-nearest neighbor algorithm is a classification algorithm used to classify data using training examples. In this paper we use SVM and KNN algorithm to classify data and get prediction (find hidden patterns) for target. Here we use medical patients nominal data to classify and discover the data pattern to predict future disease, Uses data mining which is use to classify text analysis in future.
Existing System:
Heart disease is even being highlighted as a silent killer which leads to death of a person without obvious symptoms. This nature of the disease is the cause of growing anxiety about the disease & its consequences. Hence continued efforts are being done to predict the possibility of this deadly disease in prior. So that various tools & techniques are regularly being experimented to suit the present day health needs. Machine Learning techniques can be a boon in this regard. Even though heart disease can occur in different forms, there is a common set of core risk factors that influence whether someone will ultimately be at risk for heart disease or not. By collecting the data from various sources, classifying them under suitable headings & finally analyzing to extract the desired data we can arrive at a conclusion. This technique can be very well adapted to the do the prediction of heart disease. As the well known quote says “Prevention is better than cure”, early prediction & its control can be helpful to prevent & decrease the death rates due to heart disease.
Proposed System:
Heart disease is the leading cause of death among all other diseases, even cancers. The number of men & women facing heart disease is on a raise each year. This prompts for its early diagnosis & treatment. Due to lack of resources in the medical field, the prediction of heart disease occasionally may be a problem. Utilization of suitable technology support in this regard can prove to be highly beneficial to the medical fraternity & patients. This issue can be resolved by adopting Machine Learning techniques. This paper intends to adopt SVM (Support Vector Machine) & KNN (K-Nearest Neighbor) – two techniques for the effective prediction of Heart disease. It compares the efficiency & accuracy of the two techniques to decide among them the best.
System Architecture:
 
Figure 1. Architecture Diagram

The working of this system is described in a step by step:
1. Dataset collection which contains patient details.
2. Attributes selection process selects the useful attributes for the prediction of heart disease.
3. After identifying the available data resources, they are further selected, cleaned, made into the desired form.
4. Different classification techniques as stated will be applied on preprocessed data to predict the accuracy of heart disease.
5. Accuracy measure compares the accuracy of different classifiers.

MODULES:
Support Vector Machine (SVM):
Support Vector Machine is an extremely popular supervised machine learning technique (having a pre-defined target variable) which can be used as a classifier as well as a predictor. For classification, it finds a hyper-plane in the feature space that differentiates between the classes. An SVM model represents the training data points as points in the feature space, mapped in such a way that points belonging to separate classes are segregated by a margin as wide as possible. The test data points are then mapped into that same space and are classified based on which side of the margin they fall.

K- NEAREST NEIGHBOUR ALGORITHM (KNN):
KNN is slow supervised learning algorithm, it take more time to get trained classification like other algorithm is divided into two step training from data and testing it on new instance . The K Nearest Neighbour working principle is based on assignment of weight to the each data point which is called as neighbour. In K Nearest Neighbour distance is calculate for training dataset for each of the K Nearest data points now classification is done on basis of majority of votes there are three types of distances need to be measured in KNN Euclidian, Manhattan, Minkowski distance in which Euclidian will be consider most one the following formula is used to calculate their distance.
 
The algorithm for KNN is defined in the steps given below:
1. D represents the samples used in the training and k denotes the number of nearest neighbour.
2. Create super class for each sample class.
3. Compute Euclidian distance for every training sample
4. Based on majority of class in neighbour, classify the sample
